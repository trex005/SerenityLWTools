Make sure you have someone strong to garrison you.\n4. Use a resource tile or teleport to get close to an inactive pink base. Try to avoid ones from the top few alliances.\n5. Attack.\n6.

If at any point you hear your attack alarm go off, immediately go to your pinned private message and teleport to the 3rd party server.\n\nOther notes:\n• To get closer to pink bases instead of waiting for your squad to cross the map, teleport to the 3rd server, wait 4.5 minutes and teleport back to 996\n• Every time you teleport, drop your coords in chat so your garrison(s) can follow you.",

Just make sure their squad lands first, so you end up attacking them rather than defending.\n\n2. Doom Walker Sacrifice:\n• Put all three of your squads on your wall.\n• Start a rally against a nearby Doom Walker that's too strong for you.\n• Ask someone to join your rally with a single-hero squad to avoid excess losses.\n• Announce it in Alliance Chat so others don't redirect your rally.\n\nBoth methods are great for clearing troops quickly without wasting stamina or extra resources.",

      "content": "<p>Imagine we're all in high school.</p>\n\n    <p>The football and soccer teams are full of talented, high-profile students. But for whatever reason, many others in the school <em>perceive</em> them as arrogant or unapproachable. Maybe it's how they carry themselves, maybe it's past behavior, or maybe it's just the dynamic that's developed over time. Either way, they're seen by some as the ones always dominating the space and pushing others around... even kids from the chess club, the debate team, and sometimes even the baseball team.</p>\n\n    <p>As a result, a lot of strong, capable students choose not to participate. They don't want to be part of something they feel is unfair or aggressive. And because of that, the football and soccer teams struggle when it comes time to actually win games.</p>\n\n    <p>But here's the thing: if those teams made a genuine effort to be kind, supportive, and inclusive to everyone in the school district... if they showed respect and created a positive culture, they'd have a massive pool of students eager to join them. People would be excited to be part of that energy. Their games would sell out. They'd attract the best coaches, get the best gear, and build something unstoppable.</p>\n\n    <p>So now, the teams decide to fix that by recruiting, or rather pressuring, the strong kids to join them. When persuasion doesn't work, the message turns into something more like:</p>\n\n    <p><strong>\"If you don't join us, we're going to make your life miserable every day after school.\"</strong></p>\n\n    <p>There's no way for the individual students to stand up to that. No one can take on an entire team.</p>\n\n    <p>The solution isn't to double down on fear or pressure. The solution is to fix the reputation. Be the alliance people admire, not the one they brace against. If you become the heroes of the server... the ones who stand up for fairness, respect, and real leadership, people will want to follow you. You'll have more strength, more loyalty, and more staying power than fear could ever buy.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://LWSerenity.com/?index#tip-996-moving-forward\">Back to index</a>",

      "content": "<h1>What Is Our Goal in 996?</h1>\n\n<p>Those of you who know me are probably tired of hearing me say it, but I'll say it again: It's just a game. It should be fun.</p>\n\n<p>For most of us, myself included, \"fun\" includes kicking ass. And for many, getting our asses kicked over and over again drains the fun entirely. That's exactly what happened last season. We got steamrolled, and nobody enjoyed it.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a huge number of players whose idea of fun is, as Lelii put it, \"playing Farmville.\" And we need to recognize just how essential those players are. They're the foundation that supports the rest of us - the ones who enjoy running and gunning. Without their steady production, daily activity, and logistical support, our ability to fight crumbles. Every role matters.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's a conversation happening about how to make us stronger as a server. That's good. But I want to challenge the assumption behind one of the most vocal solutions: forced mergers backed by threats of removing NAP status.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, we need to grow our top alliances. But forced consolidation isn't strength. It's short-term numbers at the cost of long-term stability. We've already tried it once. It made a few alliances stronger on paper, but it drove away countless active players. Some of our best - Moose, Ballsak, Gunny - all quit because of the drama and pressure that followed. That strategy didn't leave us stronger. It left us hollow.</p>\n\n<p>If we do it again, we'll repeat the same mistake. We'll get a short-term bump and a long-term decline.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what should we do instead?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, let's agree on the real opportunity here. It is a power problem - but it's a power problem we've already lost. We're going up against servers that have far more financial investment behind them. Trying to match them head-to-head is like lining up against Red Coats in a traditional battlefield. That's not going to work for us. If we want to win, we have to take the strategic route - the American Revolution approach - popping out from behind trees, striking smart and fast, and vanishing before they can respond. That requires tight coordination, not just brute strength. And right now, our biggest weakness is communication.</p>\n\n<p>We're not losing because our players are bad or because they're in the \"wrong\" alliances. We're losing because we don't communicate well enough to align casual players with daily goals that win us the big server-wide events.</p>\n\n<p>The buffs from Warzone Duel, for example, are massive. But we miss out on them because too many players log in and have no idea what needs doing that day. If they had a simple list every day - in their inbox, or on Discord - we'd be racking up points, not losing ground.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's not a guess. That's something we can start fixing right now.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Here's a better plan to build a powerful server:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Get our leadership in sync.</strong> Let's bring all willing leaders - big and small - into Discord so we can talk in real time. The in-game chat is simply not built for serious coordination. Messages disappear in seconds, there's no search, no ability to organize by topic, and no easy way to keep track of ongoing discussions. Discord gives us persistent channels, searchable history, threaded conversations, and notifications we can control. It's the only realistic way to maintain strategic, server-wide communication.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Treat the server like one giant alliance.</strong> Our top alliances should feel like the major leagues - not just powerful, but welcoming, aspirational, and connected to the broader server community. If players see a path to success and recognition, they'll be motivated to grow.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Send a daily mail with an agenda. A quick update with what needs to happen each day, what's coming up next, and why it matters.</li>\n      <li>Mentor our smaller alliances. Not everyone has the time or experience to run a well-oiled team, but some of us are really good at it. If we treat the server as the team - not just our individual alliances - we can help way more players than the 100-member limit. Many leaders and players would thrive with just a little support and encouragement. Let's help them grow into their potential instead of replacing them.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n  <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: flex-start;\">\n    <div style=\"flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;\">\n      <strong>Establish systems that support all playstyles.</strong> Whether someone is a heavy spender or just logs in once a day to harvest, we should have tools, guides, and communities that help them level up. Even in the biggest battle, a level 10 player with a single level 1 troop can ash a whale. There are dozens of ways small players can get involved if we can revitalize communication. When everyone can find a role and grow quickly, they're more likely to invite friends to join them.\n    </div>\n    <img src=\"http://lwserenity.com/tip_images/two-troop-victory.jpg\" width=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Two Troop Victory\">\n  </div>\n</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Launch an outreach and recruitment push.</strong> Once the above pieces are in place - reputation repaired, communication flowing, and a sense of progress - we can start promoting the server. Let's create Reddit posts, Facebook outreach - maybe we even have someone who'll make TikToks showcasing what makes our server unique. New players are still coming to this game, and many of the old ones might even return. If we become known as the server where community thrives, they'll want to be here.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>(Optional) Build a tool to help coordinate.</strong> While I'm not willing to commit to anything quite yet, I've already started building a tool for my own alliance, Serenity, at <a href=\"https://LWSerenity.com\" target=\"_blank\">LWSerenity.com</a>. If the need is there, I could create something similar for the entire server to help make communication and coordination automatic and sustainable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And yes, some smaller alliances do need to consolidate. But let's do it through alignment, not coercion. Let's show players that their play style has a home, that their time matters, and that we actually care how they enjoy the game. That's how you keep a server strong: by building a community, not a prison.</p>\n\n<p>I want to win. I want all of us to win. And I believe we'll only get there by fixing the foundation - not by tearing down what little we have left.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I hope you'll consider this seriously. We're all on the same side here. Let's act like it.</strong></p>",
