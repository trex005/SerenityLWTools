Make sure you have someone strong to garrison you.<br>\n4. Use a resource tile or teleport to get close to an inactive pink base. Try to avoid ones from the top few alliances.<br>\n5. Attack.<br>\n6.

If at any point you hear your attack alarm go off, immediately go to your pinned private message and teleport to the 3rd party server.<br>\n<br>\nOther notes:<br>\n• To get closer to pink bases instead of waiting for your squad to cross the map, teleport to the 3rd server, wait 4.5 minutes and teleport back to 996<br>\n• Every time you teleport, drop your coords in chat so your garrison(s) can follow you.</p><br><br><a href=\"/?cw-index#tip-warzone-duel-capitol-war-index\">Back to index</a>",

Coordinated Tile Hit (Most Effective):\n• Find someone from another alliance to help.\n• Have them place a strong squad on a resource tile.\n• You attack the tile with a weak squad.\nBecause attackers take the highest losses and it costs zero stamina, this is a fast, efficient method with minimal healing needed.\n\nOptional Stealth Tip:\nTo avoid breaking your shield, getting war fever, or triggering an attack alert, you can send your squad to gather on the tile before their squad lands. Just make sure their squad lands first, so you end up attacking them rather than defending.\n\n2. Doom Walker Sacrifice:\n• Put all three of your squads on your wall.\n• Start a rally against a nearby Doom Walker that's too strong for you.\n• Ask someone to join your rally with a single-hero squad to avoid excess losses.\n• Announce it in Alliance Chat so others don't redirect your rally.\n\nBoth methods are great for clearing troops quickly without wasting stamina or extra resources.",

      "content": "<p>Imagine we're all in high school.</p>\n\n    <p>The football and soccer teams are full of talented, high-profile students. But for whatever reason, many others in the school <em>perceive</em> them as arrogant or unapproachable. Maybe it's how they carry themselves, maybe it's past behavior, or maybe it's just the dynamic that's developed over time. Either way, they're seen by some as the ones always dominating the space and pushing others around... even kids from the chess club, the debate team, and sometimes even the baseball team.</p>\n\n    <p>As a result, a lot of strong, capable students choose not to participate. They don't want to be part of something they feel is unfair or aggressive. And because of that, the football and soccer teams struggle when it comes time to actually win games.</p>\n\n    <p>But here's the thing: if those teams made a genuine effort to be kind, supportive, and inclusive to everyone in the school district... if they showed respect and created a positive culture, they'd have a massive pool of students eager to join them. People would be excited to be part of that energy. Their games would sell out. They'd attract the best coaches, get the best gear, and build something unstoppable.</p>\n\n    <p>So now, the teams decide to fix that by recruiting, or rather pressuring, the strong kids to join them. When persuasion doesn't work, the message turns into something more like:</p>\n\n    <p><strong>\"If you don't join us, we're going to make your life miserable every day after school.\"</strong></p>\n\n    <p>There's no way for the individual students to stand up to that. No one can take on an entire team.</p>\n\n    <p>The solution isn't to double down on fear or pressure. The solution is to fix the reputation. Be the alliance people admire, not the one they brace against. If you become the heroes of the server... the ones who stand up for fairness, respect, and real leadership, people will want to follow you. You'll have more strength, more loyalty, and more staying power than fear could ever buy.</p>\n\n<a href=\"/?index#tip-996-moving-forward\">Back to index</a>",

      "content": "<h1>What Is Our Goal in 996?</h1>\n\n<p>Those of you who know me are probably tired of hearing me say it, but I'll say it again: It's just a game. It should be fun.</p>\n\n<p>For most of us, myself included, \"fun\" includes kicking ass. And for many, getting our asses kicked over and over again drains the fun entirely. That's exactly what happened last season. We got steamrolled, and nobody enjoyed it.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a huge number of players whose idea of fun is, as Lelii put it, \"playing Farmville.\" And we need to recognize just how essential those players are. They're the foundation that supports the rest of us - the ones who enjoy running and gunning. Without their steady production, daily activity, and logistical support, our ability to fight crumbles. Every role matters.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's a conversation happening about how to make us stronger as a server. That's good. But I want to challenge the assumption behind one of the most vocal solutions: forced mergers backed by threats of removing NAP status.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, we need to grow our top alliances. But forced consolidation isn't strength. It's short-term numbers at the cost of long-term stability. We've already tried it once. It made a few alliances stronger on paper, but it drove away countless active players. Some of our best - Moose, Ballsak, Gunny - all quit because of the drama and pressure that followed. That strategy didn't leave us stronger. It left us hollow.</p>\n\n<p>If we do it again, we'll repeat the same mistake. We'll get a short-term bump and a long-term decline.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what should we do instead?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, let's agree on the real opportunity here. It is a power problem - but it's a power problem we've already lost. We're going up against servers that have far more financial investment behind them. Trying to match them head-to-head is like lining up against Red Coats in a traditional battlefield. That's not going to work for us. If we want to win, we have to take the strategic route - the American Revolution approach - popping out from behind trees, striking smart and fast, and vanishing before they can respond. That requires tight coordination, not just brute strength. And right now, our biggest weakness is communication.</p>\n\n<p>We're not losing because our players are bad or because they're in the \"wrong\" alliances. We're losing because we don't communicate well enough to align casual players with daily goals that win us the big server-wide events.</p>\n\n<p>The buffs from Warzone Duel, for example, are massive. But we miss out on them because too many players log in and have no idea what needs doing that day. If they had a simple list every day - in their inbox, or on Discord - we'd be racking up points, not losing ground.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's not a guess. That's something we can start fixing right now.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Here's a better plan to build a powerful server:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Get our leadership in sync.</strong> Let's bring all willing leaders - big and small - into Discord so we can talk in real time. The in-game chat is simply not built for serious coordination. Messages disappear in seconds, there's no search, no ability to organize by topic, and no easy way to keep track of ongoing discussions. Discord gives us persistent channels, searchable history, threaded conversations, and notifications we can control. It's the only realistic way to maintain strategic, server-wide communication.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Treat the server like one giant alliance.</strong> Our top alliances should feel like the major leagues - not just powerful, but welcoming, aspirational, and connected to the broader server community. If players see a path to success and recognition, they'll be motivated to grow.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Send a daily mail with an agenda. A quick update with what needs to happen each day, what's coming up next, and why it matters.</li>\n      <li>Mentor our smaller alliances. Not everyone has the time or experience to run a well-oiled team, but some of us are really good at it. If we treat the server as the team - not just our individual alliances - we can help way more players than the 100-member limit. Many leaders and players would thrive with just a little support and encouragement. Let's help them grow into their potential instead of replacing them.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n  <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: flex-start;\">\n    <div style=\"flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;\">\n      <strong>Establish systems that support all playstyles.</strong> Whether someone is a heavy spender or just logs in once a day to harvest, we should have tools, guides, and communities that help them level up. Even in the biggest battle, a level 10 player with a single level 1 troop can ash a whale. There are dozens of ways small players can get involved if we can revitalize communication. When everyone can find a role and grow quickly, they're more likely to invite friends to join them.\n    </div>\n    <img src=\"https://lwserenity.com/tip_images/two-troop-victory.jpg\" width=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Two Troop Victory\">\n  </div>\n</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Launch an outreach and recruitment push.</strong> Once the above pieces are in place - reputation repaired, communication flowing, and a sense of progress - we can start promoting the server. Let's create Reddit posts, Facebook outreach - maybe we even have someone who'll make TikToks showcasing what makes our server unique. New players are still coming to this game, and many of the old ones might even return. If we become known as the server where community thrives, they'll want to be here.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>(Optional) Build a tool to help coordinate.</strong> While I'm not willing to commit to anything quite yet, I've already started building a tool for my own alliance, Serenity, at <a href=\"https://LWSerenity.com\" target=\"_blank\">LWSerenity.com</a>. If the need is there, I could create something similar for the entire server to help make communication and coordination automatic and sustainable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And yes, some smaller alliances do need to consolidate. But let's do it through alignment, not coercion. Let's show players that their play style has a home, that their time matters, and that we actually care how they enjoy the game. That's how you keep a server strong: by building a community, not a prison.</p>\n\n<p>I want to win. I want all of us to win. And I believe we'll only get there by fixing the foundation - not by tearing down what little we have left.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I hope you'll consider this seriously. We're all on the same side here. Let's act like it.</strong></p>\n\n<a href=\"/?index#tip-996-moving-forward\">Back to index</a>",

      "content": "<div>\n\n  <p>To maximize troop production and score high in <strong>Unit Progression (Arms Race)</strong> and <strong>Total Mobilization (Friday VS)</strong>, train low-level troops continuously. Then, during the events, promote them one level at a time through higher-level barracks.</p>\n\n  <p>Barracks can <strong>train</strong> any level troops up to their max, but they can only <strong>promote</strong> to their max and nothing lower. So, train one level below what your <em>lowest</em> barrack supports with all of your barracks, and them promote them step-by-step.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your highest troop level is T9 and you have 4 barracks, train level 5 troops around the clock, then promote them through levels 6, 7, 8, and finally 9 during Unit Progression and Total Mobilization.</p>\n\n  <h3>Barrack Level Guide:</h3>\n  <p>T1: 1–3<br>\n     T2: 4–5<br>\n     T3: 6–9<br>\n     T4: 10–13<br>\n     T5: 14–16<br>\n     T6: 17–19<br>\n     T7: 20–23<br>\n     T8: 24–26<br>\n     T9: 27–29<br>\n     T10: 30</p>\n\n  <h3>During Unit Progression:</h3>\n  <p>• Grab <strong>Secretary of Security</strong> at the start.<br>\n     • Use speedups to finish any troop batches already training.<br>\n     • Begin cycling promotions through each barrack.</p>\n\n  <p>• If There's a Long Line for the Title and you don’t have troops training, promote a small batch in each barrack timed for a few minutes after your expected title time.</p>\n<h3>After you begin the promotions</h3>\n     <p>• If you’ll be available, set a timer for 15 minutes before your next promotion batch ends so you can grab the title and finish under its effect.<br>\n     • If you won’t be available, speed through your first promotion batch once you have the title.</p>\n\n  <h3>Optimizing for Friday’s Total Mobilization:</h3>\n  <p>• If you're close to your goal, queue a new batch in each barrack one level below your promote minimum.<br>\n     • Time them to finish an hour or so after reset on Friday.<br>\n     • All day Friday, set a timer for just before your earliest batch finishes, speed through all the training barracks, and start the next batch.</p>\n\n  <h3>Ongoing Strategy:</h3>\n  <p>• Whenever a batch finishes, immediately start training another one level below your promote minimum.</p>\n\n  <h3>Important Tips:</h3>\n  <p>• Barracks train different troop amounts, so you'll sometimes run low on a specific level. To fix this, either:</p>\n  <p>  - Speed through one promotion batch of that level<br>\n      - Or skip promoting in a higher barrack and train a fresh batch instead</p>\n\n  <p>• To even out batch sizes, <strong>reverse your survivors</strong>: put your best survivors in your lowest-level barrack, working up from there.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<p>• Lower level troops use significantly less resources and when your base is breeched troops are killed from the lowest to the highest, so this method gives your more powerful and more expensive troops a buffer.  <em>However, be careful when attacking because if you run out of your highest level troops, your lower level ones will start taking up space in your ER.<br>\n• It takes the exact same amount of time and resources to train low level troops and then promote them to their max, however using speedups on promotions during Unit Progression and Total Mobilization will net you the most points.\n</em></p></div>\n\n        <video width=\"400\" controls=\"\" preload=\"none\" data-alt-text=\"Reversing Barracks Survivors\" poster=\"https://lwserenity.com/tip_images/reverse_barrack_survivors.jpg\">\n          <source src=\"https://lwserenity.com/tip_images/reverse_barrack_survivors.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n          Your browser does not support the video tag.\n        </video>",

      "content": "<div>\n  <h1>Protecting Your Troops</h1>\n\n  <p>Here are proven strategies to keep your troops safe during high-risk events, wars, or when you're away from the game, all while staying battle-ready.</p>\n\n  <h2>Hospital</h2>\n  <p>Let your hospital fill naturally through events like Marshal, Siege, Loot Goblins, and Doom Walkers. If you need to speed it up, send your weakest squad to a resource tile and have someone with a much stronger squad hit it. As long as your squad lands first, around 60% of your troops will go to the hospital.</p>\n\n  <p>If the hospital is getting close to full or you need some troops back, clear a small portion at a time using <a href=\"https://LWSerenity.com/#tip-moblie-spam-heal\">spam healing</a>. Even in a casual alliance, it's possible to clear around 6,000 troops per minute.</p>\n\n  <p>Before a major battle, or once your hospital is nearly full and you don't expect many incoming losses, clear all the room in your hospital by starting healing the entire batch. Aim to keep at least 3 days' worth of healing speedups available at all times.</p>\n\n  <h2>Emergency Room (ER)</h2>\n  <p>Let your ER fill completely before using the rescue option. Only claim rescued troops when you really need them or once the ER is full again and the cooldown has ended.</p>\n\n  <h2>Troop Promotions</h2>\n  <p>Promote troops in all available barracks. They are completely safe inside and will not be harmed during attacks.</p>\n\n  <h2>Garrisons and Deployment</h2>\n  <p>Squads cannot be harmed while marching or garrisoning shielded allies. If no shielded bases are available, send squads to attack zombies in the furthest corner of the map. If you plan to use Squad 1 for combat, send it first to lock in your highest-tier troops, then send Squads 2 and 3. Afterward, recall Squad 1 for use in battle. This is not an effective method if you are teleporting right into the heat of the battle.</p>\n\n  <h2>Tiered Troop Buffers</h2>\n  <p>While not a perfect defense, using the <a href=\"https://LWSerenity.com/#tip-troop-training-strategy\">tiered troop strategy</a> creates a buffer of lower-tier troops. These are the first to die if your base is breached, helping protect your top-tier units.</p>\n</div>",

Each refresh costs 5 tickets, so you'll need 25 total. If you don't have enough, wait a few minutes while others join and gift you tickets.\n\nOnce it's gold, you get all unplundered prizes, so you can keep refreshing until you find a good set. If you see something \"good enough,\" it's best to accept it.\n\nVIP vs Defender:\nThe only difference is that Defenders can use squads to defend. Most trains get robbed no matter who defends, so don't stress the choice too much.\n\nTo assign a VIP or Defender:\n• Click the chair icon in the top left of the platform screen\n• Follow the prompts\n• Wait for them to accept\n• Ask which 2 cars they want rewards from and set the green checkmarks on those cars accordingly",
